# State and Routing

Continuing our React learning journey, we'll look into 2 core React concepts. **State & Hooks**. And following up on events, which I briefly touched upon last time.

Combined with a problem we'll encounter in (almost) all web applications, **Routing**.

## Learning goals & objectives

1. What is Hooks?
2. What is State?
   1. Why do we need it and what is it used for?
3. Responding to Events
4. A brief introduction to Routing, and some of its basic functionality.
