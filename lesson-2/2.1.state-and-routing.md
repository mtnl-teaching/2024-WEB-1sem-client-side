# State & Routing

Continuing our React learning journey, we'll look into 2 core React concepts. **State & Hooks**. And following up on events, which I briefly touched upon last time.

Combined with a problem we'll encounter in (almost) all web applications, **Routing**.

## Follow up since last

See [this commit](https://github.com/mtnl-teaching/2024-WEB-1sem-client-side/commit/dffda5403a5c2089319368c857505effafc217c1) for additional resources added to lesson 1.

See this article ([Delightful React File/Directory Structure](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/)) for a more advanced take on structurering your components.
