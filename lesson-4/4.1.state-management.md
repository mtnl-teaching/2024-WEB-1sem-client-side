# State management

... And some other topics.

This week, we'll primarily look into the concept of 'State Management'.
A very important topic when working with React, atleast if we want to keep our code clean(er), and avoid stuff like: `Props Drilling`, and unneccesary dependencies in our Components.

We'll also dip our toes into a topic, which some call, `tri-state`.

And lastly, we'll try to create our own custom hook.

## Learning goals & objectives

At the end of this session you will be able to answer these questions:

1. What is State Management (In React) and why do we need it?
   1. What is Props drilling ?
   2. How do we use tools to solve these problems?
